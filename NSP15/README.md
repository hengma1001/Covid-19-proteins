# Uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU/nsp15) | YP\_009725310.1

The homolog model of nsp15 produces a hexamer, as the template $2H85$ is characterized by XRD. Here I think we can only get around with monomer as indicted in its label, no-structural protein, instead of order pack in the crystal structure.
