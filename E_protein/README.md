# Envelope small membrane protein (E protein) | YP\_009724392.1 | P0DTC4 
E protein plays a central role in virus morphogenesis and assembly. Acts as a viroporin and self-assembles in host membranes forming pentameric protein-lipid pores that allow ion transport. Also plays a role in the induction of apoptosis.

## Justification 
E protein is membrane protein, however without orientation on cell membrane. It might be challenging to identify the right drug candinates with solvent environment. But the porin structure can be possibly disturbed at the assemble process within the host cell forming a generation of virus with misfunction membrane.
